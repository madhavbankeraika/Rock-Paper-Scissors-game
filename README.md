# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This Python program is a text-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, allowing a user to play against the computer. The game operates as follows:

User Input: The user is prompted to enter their choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects its choice from the same options.
Winner Determination: The program compares the user's choice with the computer's choice based on these rules:
Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Display Results: The program displays both choices and announces the winner or if itâ€™s a tie.
Replay Option: The user is asked if they want to play another round, and the game continues until the user decides to stop.
